To generate transaction files using the python code use the following command
1. python generateTransactionFile.py transaction-1.txt sleep
2. python generateTransactionFile.py transaction-2.txt nosleep

The first one generates transaction file with sleep statements in between while the 2nd one generates transaction file with no sleep.

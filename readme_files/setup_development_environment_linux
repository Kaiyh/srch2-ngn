4. As of April 2013, we have cleaned up the codebase to speedup the compiling process. As a consequence, we need to use cmake with a version at least 2.8.8. To install a latest cmake, do the following:
Install cmake 2.8.8 if it's not available on your machine:

    -- Go to http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html, download a cmake package at least 2.8.8 and save it to a local folder;

    -- Run "tar xcvf" to unzip the tarball to a local folder, e.g., /home/chenli/cmake-2.8.10.2-Linux-i386. Modify the ~/.bashrc file and add the following line to make sure we use this cmake package:

       export PATH="/home/chenli/cmake-2.8.10.2-Linux-i386/bin:$PATH"
    -- Restart the bash.
    -- After that, run "which cmake" and "cmake --version" to confirm if the right cmake version is on your PATH.
    -- The package could be 32-bit. If your OS is a 64-bit OS, run the following command to do install the ia32-libs libraries, which allow you to run the 32-bit process on your 64-bit OS:
       sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

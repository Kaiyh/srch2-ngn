 * This operator is a simple scan operator. It starts with a set of activenodes,
 * finds all the leaf nodes based on the term type (prefix or complete),
 * saves all the connected inverted lists, and then in each getNext call returns
 * one record from a list until all lists are iterated completely.
 * The difference between this operator and TVL is that this operator doesn't give
 * any guarantee of order for its output (the output is NOT sorted by score) and
 * it doesn't have the overhead of HEAP that TVL has.

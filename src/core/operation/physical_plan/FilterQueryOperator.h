 * The following two classes implement filter_query as a physical operator.
 * This operator only exists if a filter_query request comes with the query.
 * For example query : q = A AND B OR C & fq = "model='TOYOTA'"
 * If this operator exists, it goes exactly one top of lowest level
 * term nodes so that it filters the records as soon as the come out of
 * inverted index.
 * The core physical plan of this example is :
 *
 *
 * [OR sorted by ID]___[SORT BY ID]____[FilterQueryOperator]____[SCAN C]
 *       |
 *       |_____________[SORT BY ID]___[Merge TopK]____[FilterQueryOperator]____[TVL A]

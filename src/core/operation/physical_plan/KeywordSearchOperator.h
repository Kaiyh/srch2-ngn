 * KeywordSearchOperator is a special operator which does the main search.
 * It can be viewed as a controller and executor of other search modules.
 * These tasks are done in this operator:
 * 1. Exact/Fuzzy policy is implemented in this operator. So tasks 2 to ??? are repeated for fuzzy query if
 * ---- we don't get enough results from exact.
 * 2. The number of results that we need is calculated based on searchType and postProcessing request (like having Facet)
 * 3. It uses HistogramManager to annotate the LogicalPlan for further steps.
 * 4. It uses QueryOptimizer to build a good physical plan (which is the core plan)
 * 5. It opens the plan (by calling open(...)) and calls getNext as many times as needed .

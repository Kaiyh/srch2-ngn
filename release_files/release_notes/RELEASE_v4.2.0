*------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes over version 4.1.0:
* Tag names and attribute names are now case insensitive.
* GetAll search type is optimized. If the number of results of the query is greater than 10K, estimated number of results is returned instead of exact number of results.
* Tag "queryTermType" is now changed to "queryTermPrefixType"
* Tag "queryTermMatchType" is now changed to "queryTermFuzzyType"
* Support of multivalued attributes is added. Attributes can be declared as multivalued and contain a JSON array as their value in the data file.
* Optimization is done for short prefixes. If a query is a single prefix that is very popular (e.g., "q=a"), a heuristic is used to increase the performance by first computing the most likely completions and then using them to compute answers.
* Added a parameter f.field_name.rows in a facet condition to define the number of categories with the maximal frequencies to be returned. All categories are returned by default. This parameter is only valid for categorial facets.

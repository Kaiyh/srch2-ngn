*------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes over version 4.1.0:
* Tag names and attribute names are now case insensitive.
* GetAll search type is optimized. If the number of results of the query is greater than 10K, estimated number of results is returned instead of exact number of results.
* Tag "queryTermType" is now changed to "queryTermPrefixType"
* Tag "queryTermMatchType" is now changed to "queryTermFuzzyType"
* Support of multivalued attributes is added. Attributes can be declared as multivalued and contain JSON array as their value in the data file.
* Optimization is done for short prefixes. If a query has only a single too popular prefix, a heuristic is used to increase the performance.

 * This class defines a query that is passed to the IndexSearcher. A

 * query.  A query with multiple terms is interpreted using the "AND"
 * semantics.  The query is responsible for freeing the space of the
 * terms when the query object is deleted.  The following is an
 * example:
 *
 * Query *q = new Query();
 * Term term1 = new FuzzyTerm("pizza", PREFIX, 1, 100);
 * q.add(term1);
 *
 * Term term2 = new FuzzyTerm("delivery", PREFIX, 1, 100);
 * q.add(term2);
 *
 * Term term3 = new FuzzyTerm("irvine", PREFIX, 1, 100);
 * q.add(term3);
 *
 * Term term4 = new FuzzyTerm("free", PREFIX, 1, 100);
 * q.add(term4);
 *
 * delete q; // deletes q and also all the Term objects it holds.

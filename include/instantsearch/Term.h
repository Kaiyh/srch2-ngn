/**
 * This class defines a Term representing a word from text, which can
 * be used to define a keyword condition in a search query.
 *
 * This abstract base class is extended based on "matching" criteria
 * into two subclasses ExactTerm and FuzzyTerm.  These two
 * extensions can in turn be of types "PREFIX" or "COMPLETE".

 * Example: Consider a record with a word "elephant". The following
 * table shows four matching situations for a query keyword (shown in
 * the table) and the word "elephant" in the record:
 * <TABLE>
 * <TR>
 *         <TD></TD>
 *         <TD> COMPLETE MATCHING </TD>
 *         <TD> PREFIX MATCHING </TD>
 * </TR>
 * <TR>
 *         <TD> EXACT MATCHING </TD>
 *         <TD> elephant </TD>
 *         <TD> elep </TD>
 * </TR>
 * <TR>
 *         <TD> FUZZY MATCHING </TD>
 *         <TD> eliphant </TD>
 *         <TD> elip </TD>
 * </TR>
 * </TABLE>
 *
 *
 * Each term is associated with four values used in the search and
 * ranking process.

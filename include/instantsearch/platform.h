/*
Buildfiles will define MyLibrary_EXPORTS on Windows where it is
configured to build a shared library. If you are going to use
another build system on windows or create the visual studio
projects by hand you need to define MyLibrary_EXPORTS when
building a DLL on windows.
By default, bimaple build infrastructure uses the Visual Studio
Compiler and builds Shared libraries on Windows platform.
